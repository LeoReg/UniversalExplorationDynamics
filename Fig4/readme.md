In this file one can find the python programs:
-Surface.py: to obtain the elapsed time between increments first observation of a surface S and S+2 for a 2d random walk.
-Islands.py: to obtain the elapsed time between increments first observation of a I and I+1 islands for a 1d Lévy flight.
-Starvation2d.py: to obtain the starvation time T_S on the 2d square lattice.
-Cov.py: to obtain the 2, 3 and 4 time covariance of a 1d Lévy flight
-frBm.py: to obtain the \tau_n variables for fractional brownian motion. 
-TSAW.py: to obtain the \tau_n variables for true self avoiding random walks.
